            Hi I’m Choyo. I’m currently live in south bay area of California. I am Japanese. 
            I was born and raised in Japan, but I decided to come to the US when I was 18 years old. 
            Here I want to talk about my story. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In Japan, most of high school students take entrance exams to go to universities in Japan. 
            I was studying for the exam until I visited to one of the university where I found the booth of exchange student program. I stayed with a host family in San Diego, CA for 2 weeks when I was 14. 
            Because my cousin was studying there at that time, we stayed at her friend’s family. It was really fun and had great experience. However, I never thought about the options to choose the university far away from home.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            My family is normal Japanese family. Both my parents worked, and so my grand parents took care of me and my younger brother since we were little. 
            I was very spoiled. I was given so much love from my family, and never thought I would leave them. 
            After the day I visited the university, my auntie whose daughter was studying in San Diego visited my grand parents during summer vacation. Usually, if you are going to take the entrance exam, you need to choose which university to go by the end of summer. 
            She asked me if I decided which ones to go. I told her about the exchange program, and she told me she thought I was going to go to the university in the US. 
            Her comment really hit my head and started to think I wanted to study at the university in the US.

          <p>
            Next day, I told my mom I wanted to studying the US. She was worried about what I said because she never expected that. That night, my dad, mom, and I had family meeting. 
            I told them I would like to learn business in the US, so I should be able to speak English and so I would be more competitive and have better resume in the future. 
            My dad gave me with an assignment that he wanted me to submit a report showing my plans and goals for studying in the US, and which college to go to, and how much cost would be expected for the school and living. 
            Also, he told me that he would pay all my expenses and tuitions if I could show them how serious I was. I went to bookstore and bought the book for studying abroad and also contacted my cousin to gather information as much as I could for the report. 
            I filled out whole notebook and submitted to my parents. They looked at my report and approved my decision. That’s how I started the life in the US.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I first moved to San Diego, CA, and stayed with one of my cousin’s friend family. I went the language school in San Diego State since I couldn't speak English at all. 
            However, I met many friends who helped me to improve my English and taught me a lot of things I never knew. I was able to pass TOEFUL to go to Grossmont college in El Cajon to started my college life. 
            After I studied a year and half at Grossmont, I decided to moved to Hawaii. Living in Hawaii was great experience, but it was hard to live because everything was expensive. Therefore, I moved back to California and started to go to the Cal State University Fullerton.  
            I graduated in 2008 with BA accounting degree. Majoring in accounting was tough, but I was happy when my parents came to the US to celebrate my graduation. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Since I was an international student, I needed to obtain working visa to stay and work in the US. Luckily, I was able to applied and obtain the visa to start working at a Japanese IT company in Torrance, CA. 
            I was not interested in working at accounting firm, so looked for job that related with any accounting field. At that first job, I learned about ERP system and helpdesk support. 
            Also, I processed accounting operations. Due to the financial crisis in 2009, my pay rate went down which gave me really tough time and made me start thinking to go back to Japan. 
            However, one of the ex-coworker offered me ERP consulting job at the company he worked. I was able to transfer my working visa to the new company and started the new carrier as ERP consultant. 
            I learned a lot with this company not only for ERP but also presales and managing my own team and project. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I’m with the company for almost 9 years and started to think I want to learn something new. With ERP related jobs, I needed to understand how the system designed and programmed, and also needed to test the program before releasing to the customer. 
            I don’t have programing skills, but I wished I would know at least basic coding. That’s what made me to take the coding class at UC Riverside. I will do my best to add coding knowledge and skills for my success carrier path.
